### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nate, I go by TerrorByte or variations online (TerrrorByte, TerrorByteTW, etc.). I'm a tech enthusiast who has never had a job in Software Development, yet it's literally one of my favorite things to do ðŸ˜œ

I mainly develop Spigot plugins but I want to dabble in some other languages in the future!

## My work

My "flagship" plugin is Honeypot, an anti-grief plugin designed to help catch griefers. I develop it for fun, but people actually use it, which is kinda cool! Check out some stats below on it

I also stream on Twitch Tuesdays and Saturdays at 8:30 PM CST. If you want to vibe with us, check us out below ðŸ˜„
